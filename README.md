# To-Do-List
A CRUD To-do List that allows user to add items

Description: This application allows the user to enter up to 10 individual items. After adding an item, the user can edit the textbox of the item, or if they so desire, 
delete the item in its entirity. This system follows the CRUD layout (create, read, update, delete). There also exists (in the top right) a button to clear all to-do list entries.

Project Overview: While there were certainly challenges that came along with this given project, it was suprisingly much easier than originally anticipated. That's not at all
to say it was easy however. Far from it. Many things that I thought would take a great deal of time instead only took a couple minutes while the inverse is true for other things. 
By far the most challenging thing about this project was the saving to the browser. Everything else was relativly simple compared to this feature. I feel that this project greatly
improved my JS programming skills & look forward to the next project which will hopefully do the same.
